Large update. I finished the rendering and update cycles. We can now create objects as we please.

Runnable Object has been added. Please take a good look at it for it is the base of almost everything we render to the screen. Feel free to create your own objects to test it out. What we need now is defined character movement and falling blocks. I could really use some help with that.

I also started setting up collision detection. That stuff is incredibly difficult and I will be attempting to tackle it next week.

As for the menu, we really need the art to do anything major with it so I think we should wait on it a bit.

Have fun with it!
