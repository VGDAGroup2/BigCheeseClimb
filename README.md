Death update. The character can now die. After death you are transported back to the menu.

Added some removal and reset methods to Runnable Object, Game Runner and GameState.
Modified Character to reset the game when he is below the screen.

(We might want to run a game over screen at some point in there, I will work on it later)

That's all folks.
