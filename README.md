Falling Platforms Game mechanic complete!
The character now cannot move above the midpoint of the screen and when he tries to it just moves the platforms down faster.

Reworked Platform Controls to spawn platforms after the previous one has gone a certain distance. (You did good work Josh it just needed to change for this).

Removed some "fat" from MainCharacter and added the mechanic that does not allow him to go higher.

Added a height reached variable to GameState. It will keep track of our total height. It still needs some work.

I think we have done an amazing amount of work on the game itself. Great Job to all of you. It is time to move to the next phase:
Let's start working on the menu. Remember, the menu should have 3 buttons. 1: Start the game; 2: Instructions; 3: Credits.
